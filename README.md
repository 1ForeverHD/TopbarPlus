**TopbarPlus** is a module enabling the construction of dynamic topbar icons. These icons can be enhanced with features and methods, like themes, dropdowns and menus, to expand upon their appearance and behaviour.

TopbarPlus fully supports PC, Mobile, Tablet and Console, and comes with internal features such as 'overflows' to ensure icons remain within suitable bounds.

Creating an icon is as simple as:
```lua
-- Within a LocalScript in StarterPlayerScripts and assuming TopbarPlus is placed in ReplicatedStorage

local Icon = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Icon)
local icon = Icon.new()
```
