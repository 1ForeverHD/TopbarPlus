These icons can be enhanced with features and methods like themes, dropdowns and menus to expand upon their appearance and behaviour. TopbarPlus fully supports PC, Mobile, Tablet and Gamepads (Consoles), and comes with internal features such as 'overflows' to ensure icons remain within suitable bounds. Construction \u00b6 Creating an icon is as simple as: -- Within a LocalScript in StarterPlayerScripts and assuming the Icon package is placed in ReplicatedStorage local Icon = require ( game : GetService ( \"ReplicatedStorage\" ). Icon ) local icon = Icon . new () This constructs an empty 32x32 icon on the topbar. Info The order icons appear are determined by their construction sequence. Icons constructed first will have a smaller order therefore will appear left of icons with a higher order. You can modify this behaviour using icon:setOrder . Icon orders by default are 1+(totalCreatedIcons*0.01) , so 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, etc. To add an image and label, do: icon : setImage ( imageId ) icon : setLabel ( \"Label\" ) Chaining \u00b6 These methods are 'chainable' therefore can alternatively be called doing: Icon . new () : setImage ( imageId ) : setLabel ( \"Label\" ) You may want to act upon nested icons. You can achieve this using :call which returns the icon as the first argument within the function you pass: Icon . new () : setName ( \"TestIcon\" ) : call ( function ( icon ) print ( icon . name ) -- This will print 'TestIcon'! end ) Info Chainable methods have a chainable tag next to their name within the API Icon docs. States \u00b6 Sometimes you'll want an item to appear only when deselected and similarily only when selected . You can achieve this by specifying a string value within the iconState parameter of methods containing the toggleable tag. These are: \"Deselected\" -- Applies the value when the icon is deselected (i.e. not pressed) \"Selected\" -- Applies the value when the icon is selected (i.e. pressed) \"Viewing\" -- Formerly known as Hovering, applies the value when a cursor is hovering above, a controller highlighting, or touchpad (mobile) long-pressing (but before releasing) an icon Info If no iconState is specified (i.e. is nil) the value will be applied to all states. -- It doesn't matter if you do \"deselected\", \"Deselected\" or \"dEsElEcTeD\"; iconStates are not case sensitive Icon . new () : setImage ( 4882429582 ) : setLabel ( \"Closed\" , \"Deselected\" ) : setLabel ( \"Open\" , \"Selected\" ) : setLabel ( \"Viewing\" , \"Viewing\" ) Additional \u00b6 By default icons will deselect when another icon is selected. You can disable this behaviour doing: icon : autoDeselect ( false ) You can enhance icons further with features like modifyTheme, dropdowns and menus, or by binding GuiObjects and KeyCodes to their toggle. This and much more can be achieved by exploring the Feature Guide and Icon API . Have a question or issue?

Menus \u00b6 Menus are horizontal navigation frames that contain an array of icons: Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Example\" ) : modifyTheme ({ \"Menu\" , \"MaxIcons\" , 2 }) : setMenu ({ Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Item 1\" ) , Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Item 2\" ) , Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Item 3\" ) , Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Item 4\" ) , }) Modify Theme \u00b6 You can modify the appearance of an icon doing: icon : modifyTheme ( modifications ) You can modify the appearance of all icons doing: Icon . modifyBaseTheme ( modifications ) modifications can be either a single array describing a change, or a colllection of these arrays. For example, both the following are valid: -- Single array icon : modifyTheme ({ \"IconLabel\" , \"TextSize\" , 16 }) -- Collection of arrays icon : modifyTheme ({ { \"Widget\" , \"MinimumWidth\" , 290 }, { \"IconCorners\" , \"CornerRadius\" , UDim . new ( 0 , 0 )} }) A modification array has 4 components: { name , property , value , iconState } 1. name {required} This can be: \"Widget\" (which is the icon container frame) The name of an instance within the widget such as IconGradient , IconSpot , Menu , etc A 'collective' - the value of an attribute called 'Collective' applied to some instances. This enables them to be acted upon all at once. For example, 'IconCorners'. 2. property {required} This can be either: A property from the instance (Name, BackgroundColor3, Text, etc) Or if the property doesn't exist, an attribute of that property name will be set 3. value {required} The value you want the property to become ( \"Hello\" , Color3.fromRGB(255, 100, 50) , etc) 4. iconState {optional} This determines when the modification is applied. See icon states for more details. You can find example arrays under the 'Default' module: One Click Icons \u00b6 You can convert icons into single click icons (icons which instantly deselect when selected) by doing: icon : oneClick () For example: Icon . new () : setImage ( shopImageId ) : setLabel ( \"Shop\" ) : bindEvent ( \"deselected\" , function () shop . Visible = not shop . Visible end ) : oneClick () Toggle Items \u00b6 Binds a GuiObject (such as a frame) to appear or disappear when the icon is toggled icon : bindToggleItem ( shopFrame ) It is equivalent to doing: icon . deselected : Connect ( function () shopFrame . Visible = false end ) icon . selected : Connect ( function () shopFrame . Visible = true end ) Toggle Keys \u00b6 Binds a keycode which toggles the icon when pressed. Also creates a caption hint of that keycode binding. Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Shop\" ) : bindToggleKey ( Enum . KeyCode . V ) : setCaption ( \"Open Shop\" ) Gamepad & Console Support \u00b6 TopbarPlus comes with inbuilt support for gamepads (such as Xbox and PlayStation controllers) and console screens: To highlight the last-selected icon (or left-most if none have been selected yet) users simply press DPadUp or navigate to the topbar via the virtual cursor. To change the default trigger keycode (from DPadUp) do: Icon . highlightKey = Enum . KeyCode . NEW_KEYCODE Overflows \u00b6 When accounting for device types and screen sizes, icons may occasionally overlap. This is especially common for phones when they enter portrait mode. TopbarPlus solves this with overflows: Overflows will appear when left-set or right-set icons exceed the boundary of the closest opposite-aligned icon or viewport. If a center-aligned icon exceeds the bounds of another icon, its alignment will be set to the alignment of the icon it exceeded: These examples and more can be tested, viewed and edited at the v3 Playground .","title":"Features"},{"location":"features/#images","text":"Icon . new : setImage ( shopImageId )","title":"Images"},{"location":"features/#labels","text":"icon : setLabel ( \"Shop\" ) icon : setImage ( shopImageId ) icon : setLabel ( \"Shop\" )","title":"Labels"},{"location":"features/#alignments","text":"-- Aligns the icon to the left bounds of the screen -- This is the default behaviour so you do not need to do anything -- This was formerly called :setLeft() icon : align ( \"Left\" ) -- Aligns the icon in the middle of the screen -- This was formerly called :setMid() icon : align ( \"Center\" ) -- Aligns the icon to the right bounds of the screen -- This was formerly called :setRight() icon : align ( \"Right\" )","title":"Alignments"},{"location":"features/#notices","text":"icon : notify ()","title":"Notices"},{"location":"features/#captions","text":"icon : setCaption ( \"Open Shop\" )","title":"Captions"},{"location":"features/#dropdowns","text":"Dropdowns are vertical navigation frames that contain an array of icons: Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Example\" ) : modifyTheme ({ \"Dropdown\" , \"MaxIcons\" , 3 }) : modifyChildTheme ({ \"Widget\" , \"MinimumWidth\" , 158 }) : setDropdown ({ Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Category 1\" ) , Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Category 2\" ) , Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Category 3\" ) , Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Category 4\" ) , }) Warning Icons containing a dropdown can join other menus but not dropdowns.","title":"Dropdowns"},{"location":"features/#menus","text":"Menus are horizontal navigation frames that contain an array of icons: Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Example\" ) : modifyTheme ({ \"Menu\" , \"MaxIcons\" , 2 }) : setMenu ({ Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Item 1\" ) , Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Item 2\" ) , Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Item 3\" ) , Icon . new () : setLabel ( \"Item 4\" ) , })","title":"Menus"},{"location":"features/#modify-theme","text":"You can modify the appearance of an icon doing: icon : modifyTheme ( modifications ) You can modify the appearance of all icons doing: Icon . modifyBaseTheme ( modifications ) modifications can be either a single array describing a change, or a colllection of these arrays.

When a package is required it will 'check' to see if a TopbarPlus package has already been required within the experience. If one has, it cancels loading itself and will instead refer to the already initialized package. This prevents weird quirks from occuring and means third party applications, libraries etc that use TopbarPlus can be used safely without interferring with your own implementation of TopbarPlus. You don't have to do anything to support multiple packages. Simply use TopbarPlus as normal.","title":"Third Parties"}]}
