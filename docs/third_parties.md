TopbarPlus supports the use of multiple Icon packages within a single experience. It achieves this by assigning the first-required package as the 'lead' package, then whenever a second package is required (such as via the Icon module), the lead package modules are used instead. Without this errors would occur such as overlapping icons.

You don't have to do anything for your third-party applications. Simply use TopbarPlus as normal.
