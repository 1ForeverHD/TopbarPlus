TopbarPlus is a module enabling the construction of dynamic topbar icons. These icons can be enhanced with features and methods, like themes, dropdowns and menus, to expand upon their appearance and behaviour.

TopbarPlus fully supports PC, Mobile, Tablet and Console, and comes with internal features such as 'overflows' to ensure icons remain within suitable bounds.

Creating an icon is as simple as:

``` lua
-- Within a LocalScript in StarterPlayerScripts and assuming TopbarPlus is placed in ReplicatedStorage
local Icon = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Icon)
local icon = Icon.new()
```

!!! info
    The order icons appear are determined by their construction sequence. Icons constructed first will have a smaller order number, therefore will appear left of icons with a higher order. For instance, if you construct a shop icon then an inventory icon, the shop icon will appear furthest left. You can modify this behaviour using [icon:setOrder].

This constructs an empty ``32x32`` icon on the topbar. To add an image and label, do:
```lua
icon:setImage(imageId)
icon:setLabel("Label")
```

These methods are 'chainable' therefore can alternatively be called by doing:
```lua
local icon = Icon.new()
    :setImage(imageId)
    :setLabel("Label")
```

!!! info
    Chainable methods have a ``chainable`` tag next to their name within the API Icon docs.

Sometimes you'll want an item to appear only when *deselected*, and similarily only when *selected*. You can achieve this by specifying a string value within the ``iconState`` parameter of methods containing the ``toggleable`` tag. These are:

```lua
"deselected" -- Applies the value when the icon is deselected (i.e. not pressed)
"selected" -- Applies the value when the icon is selected (i.e. pressed)
"hovering" -- Applies the value when a cursor, finger or controller is hovering over the icon
```

If no argument is specified, the value will be applied to both ``deselected`` and ``selected`` states. For example:

```lua
Icon.new()
	:setImage(4882429582)
	:setLabel("Closed", "deselected")
	:setLabel("Open", "selected")
	:setLabel("Hovering", "hovering")
```

You may wish to enhance icons further with features like themes, dropdowns and menus, or by binding GuiObjects and KeyCodes to their toggle. This and much more can be achieved by exploring the [Feature Guide] and [Icon API].

!!! warning
    It's important you set [IconController.voiceChatEnabled] to ``true`` if VoiceChat is enabled within your experience so that the BETA label can be accounted for.
