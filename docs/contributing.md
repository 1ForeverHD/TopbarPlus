    2. Visit the [TopbarPlus repository].
    3. Click *Fork* in the top right corner.
    4. Clone this fork into your local repository.

    7. Open your local website (it will look something like ``http://0.0.0.0:8000``)
    8. Any changes to ``mkdocs.yml`` or the files within ``docs`` will now update live to this local site.
