#### Take the model
{recommended}

1. Take the [TopbarPlus model](https://www.roblox.com/library/6311707237/TopbarPlus).
2. Open the toolbox and navigate to Inventory -> My Models.
3. Click TopbarPlus to insert into your game and place anywhere within ``ReplicatedStorage`` or ``Workspace``. 
4. TopbarPlus is a package so you can update it instantly (instead of re-adding) by right-clicking the Icon module and selecting an option such as 'Get Latest Package':

5. You can receive automatic updates by enabling 'AutoUpdate' within the PackageLink:

!!! info
    All v3 updates will be backwards compatible so you don't need to worry about updates interfering with your code.

!!! warning
    Try not to modify any code within the Icon package otherwise it will break the package link.

!!! important
    As of 27th March 2024 public packages haven't been rolled out by Roblox. Only after their full release will you be able to benefit from easily installable updates. For the time being, attempting to use 'Get Latest Package' and other package features will throw an error.
